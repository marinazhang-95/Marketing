<h2>I am a Marketing Analyst & Content Creator</h2>

<h3>My Passion</h3>
<p>Originating from a strong background in multifamily real estate, my student mentality allows me to easily adapt and learrn new markets and trends. My willingness to expand my knowledge is demonstrated by my self motivation to pick up a Google Analytics certiification, Florida Real Estate License, and the HTML markup language. My specialty is customer relations through both telling stories digitally as well as directly, which helped me to move upwards within my previous companies. My passiion is to make a meaningful impact and create a call to action through compelling storytelling. </p>

<h4>Content Creation (Copywriting)</h4>

<p>This is just a sample of me using HTML to prepare a simple description list, and ordered list. I recommend:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Always make a couple of sample tools and examples you can post to your website. Not only is it always beneficial to practice your markup skills, but it is also beneficial to show your potential clients exactly what you can do using HTML & CSS tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5>3 different types of samples you can create</h5>
<ul>
	<li>1.5 figure (1 figure with 0.5 caption)</li>
	<li>1 block quote example</li>
	<li>2 thematic breaks such as horizontal rules</li>
</ul>

<h5>Instructions</h5>

<ol>
	<li>Make an outline of what you want your sample to show. Plan it out in detail so you know exactly what you're talking about.</li>
	<li>Type up the raw text of everything you want to convey in your sample. Don't worry about HTML tags just yet, make sure all your information is clearly written out.</li>
	<li>Use HTML element tags to markup your ideas. Use a wide array of tags to best present your ideas. Here are some examples to help you get started: paragraphs, headings, lists, figures, etc.</li>
</ol>
